The Fong Phone is an open source synth for all of your mobile devices.

We launched this project when my shoe box became unstable and started to spark (more than usual).

You can think of this project as both a portable synth and a collaboritive art project.

The original "Pong Fong" was a device I built using a basic stamp, the innards of a cassete deck,
a shoebox, and lots of electrical tape.

It used the basic stamp to simulate two oscilators with pitches that could each be controlled a corresponding dial.

In addition each oscillator pulsed at a given frequency, but the frequencies were coupled such that the rate of pulsing
of the second oscilator was always a multiplication of the first.

When combined with the genral shaudiness of my construction and its side effects I managed milk some drones out of this set up.

The Fong Phone, extends this idea but takes advantage of all 

When my long time co-conspiratore Andrew came on board the project quickly matured into something I think is quite beautiful.

It is essential that FERC stop approving new permits for fossil fuel infrastructure such as pipelines and compressor stations. Switching to natural gas now will only leave the nation with costly stranded assets that must be abandoned if we are to avert climate disaster. It essential that FERC prioritise energy efficiency, demand side management, and safe renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. I stand in with the Beyond Extreme Energy protesters and hope that you move swiftly toward energy policy that will ensure the long term stability and safety of this great nation.
