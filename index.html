          <h1>Announcing the Fong Phone!</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          The Fong Phone is an open source Synthesizer with a unique interface.
          Designed to be both beautiful and functional it leverages the touch screen
          of your mobile device to allow you to make mind bending drones.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Fong phone is available via the GPL v2 license from our
          <a href="https://github.com/chriswininger/FongPhone">Github</a> page but may also be purchased through
          the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fongphone/id1073371447?ls=1&mt=8">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fongphone">Google Play Store</a> under a proprietary license.

        </p>
        <p>
          If you are interested in contributing or value FOSS and want to load this onto your phone without a proprietary
          license, you may feel free to obtain the project from Github, build, and load it onto your system.
