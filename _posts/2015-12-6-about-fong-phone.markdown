The `Fong Phone` is an open source Synthesizer with a unique interface. Designed to be both beautiful and functional it
leverages the touch screen of your mobile device to allow you to make mind bending drones.

The `Fong phone` is available via the GPL v2 license from our Github page but may also be purchased through the
Apple App Store and Google Play Store under a proprietary license. If you just want to enjoy this product and support
us monetarily, please grab it from the app store.

If you are interested in contributing or value FOSS and want to load this onto your phone without a proprietary license,
you may feel free to obtain the project from Github, build, and load it onto your system.
