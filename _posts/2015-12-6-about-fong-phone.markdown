The `Fong Phone` is an open source Synthesizer with a unique interface that leverages the touch screen of your mobile device.
It began life inside of a shoe-box. The original instrument dubbed the Pong Fong was a first attempt at hardware hacking,
but after being rocked hard a few too many times the duct tape began to unravel and the sparks that fly from its vast array of short circuits became too much. Thus it was time for the Fong Phone.
A stable software version of the Pong Fong that is more refined and does not start fires.
